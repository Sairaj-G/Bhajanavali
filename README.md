# Bhajanavali 
## Technology for Tradition

### Background 

The inspiration for this project came from the traditional devotional songs that have been a part of my family. The set of these traditional songs was recorded and was available as an audio file. However as all the songs were available in a single file, if one had to look out for a specific song, he would have to seek manually. Also everytime one feels like listening to these songs, he has to lookout for the file among many present on his device.

The solution that I came up was to have a mobile app with the sole goal of playing these songs. Since many elders of my family recite these songs daily (like a prayer) an app for this sole purpose looked very practical.

### Technologies Used 
Flutter was used for app development as it is cross platform, has wide variety of widgets for good UI ans has easily integrable audio packages.
[just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio) was used as it was one of the best audio packages for Flutter framework and had good documentation.

### Key Features 
The audio player has all the features of any other audio player such as play/pause, restart a song all over, fast-forward and fast-backward.  
All the text in the app is in Marathi which is my native language and suits the purpose as all these devotional songs are in Marathi.
